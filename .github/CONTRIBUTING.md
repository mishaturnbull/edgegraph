# Contributing to edgegraph

## Security issues

Please do not open a Github issue if the issue is a security vulnerability;
instead refer to the [security
policy](https://github.com/mishaturnbull/edgegraph/security/policy).

## Contributions

Edgegraph welcomes contributions via one of two methods:

1. for core maintainers, via a pull request across branches within the repo
2. for all else, via a pull request across a fork

In both cases, please ensure the target branch is not `master`.

All contributions must be in accordance with the code of conduct.
