"""
Build graphs in the most manual form possible; taking two vertices and linking
them.

This module provides facilities for explicit, direct linking of vertices in
order to gradually build out a graph.

Most of the functions in this module are one-liners.  Seriously.  It exists to
standardize the methods by which links are associated, so that changes to the
structure classes can occur without breaking everyone's code -- instead, these
functions will get the necessary updates to match, and the API stays unchanged.
