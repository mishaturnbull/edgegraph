"""
Create graphs using the PyVis framework.

This module supports exporting networks for, and shortcutting the display of,
`PyVis`_ networks / graphs.  This feature is only available if the ``pyvis``
module is installed -- otherwise, attempting to import this module will raise
an :py:exc:`ImportError` detailing this and how to install pyvis.

PyVis itself provides an interactive, HTML-based rendering of graphs.  Users
can zoom, pan around graphs, and click-and-drag the nodes themselves.  Nodes
and edges can be individually labelled, colors, sizes, and weights can be
applied, and the physics model can be optionally be changed via the UI's
customizations.  See `PyVis`_'s documentation for more information, and demos.

Generally, the usage pattern for this module is intended to be as:

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   from edgegraph.builder import randgraph
   from edgegraph.output import pyvis

   uni = randgraph.randgraph()

   if you_want_customizable_ui:
       pvn = pyvis.pyvis_render_customizable(uni, rvfunc=lambda v: str(v.i))
   else:
       pvn = pyvis.make_pyvis_net(uni, rvfunc=lambda v: str(v.i))

   # notebook=False for usage outside of a Jupyter notebook.  this call will
   # block as the web browser opens to show the HTML file
   pvn.show("example.html", notebook=False)
